This webpage is designed as an informal way to distribute homebrew projects, as well as way to train myself to be concise in writing technical material in a non-technical way.
 </p>
 <p>
I am a recent graduate from Aarhus University; holding a degree as International Master of Science in Quantitative Economics (<i>Danish title: </i> Cand. Oecon (IMSQE)), wiith my thesis being written on the subject of big-data incorporation in unstable structural macroeconometrics.

<p> The site is in early development, as I am still working on the optimal approach to website development. Any recommendations or comments is accepted with gratitude.</p>
