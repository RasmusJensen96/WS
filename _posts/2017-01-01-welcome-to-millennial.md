## Hypothesis
Empirical findings suggest that predictability of financial returns differs through business cycles; high predictability under recessions, low during expansions. Can we replicate this empirical finding in a structural asset pricing model?

## Execution strategy
Setup and estimate a structural consumption-based asset pricing model. Simulate a large number of stock/bond returns under different states of the economy.
